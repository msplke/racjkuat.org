      "Personally I'm a very social person, an extrovert labda. But despite that, kukuwa extrovert has not helped me so much kwa side ya kumeet new people. Yes I'm good with crowds and all that but sasa ikifika the time nafaa kuapproach people and get to know them ile ya kabisa, the introverted side of me tends to come out. I joined Rotaract because my close friend was the club president at that time and alikuwa amenipush sana to come for their meetings, and I'm glad I did. Rotaract has helped me so much to not feel afraid to express myself in front of people. Watu wa Rotaract ni watu very social, hutaboeka. So most of the times huwa najipata nimecreate bonds with people ata I couldn't expect nikuwe friends na wao. That has been a big step for me and I'm proud of myself. I'm really grateful for that.",

      "Rac JKUAT has been everything for me. My mantra in life has been, 'Our main purpose is to help others in life and if you can't, at the very least don't hurt them.' Rac JKUAT has enabled me to be more compassionate, kind, empathetic, less selfish, and above all to be of service to the community and people around me, therefore living my mantra. The best part of it all is that I get to do this while having fun which is amazing‚ùóÔ∏è Rac JKUAT has been amazing. üíØ",

      "It gave me a place to live, I don't usually interact with that many people but it has been a platform for meeting new people, making new memories, having fun and generally being a better version of myself. I love that it is a community that focuses on giving back and helping those in need, and that part really sits tight with me. My only regret is that I didn't join sooner. üòÇüò≠ But all in all I LOVE IT OVER HERE. ‚ù§Ô∏è",

      "I have enjoyed my time as an aspiring member. The selflessness displayed by the Rotaractors during service was striking and is something I look forward to applying during my time as a member of RAC JKUAT and beyond. I will find it hard to forget the smiles I saw during the community service projects I've attended. I think selflessness is a good principle to live by. I was also encouraged by the mother club visits and the short talks with industry professionals which have been of great importance to me. They serve as encouragement to keep working on my academics in order to achieve what they have and maybe even more. I look forward to my time as a Rotaractor.",
