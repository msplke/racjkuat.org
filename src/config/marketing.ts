      "Personally I'm a very social person, an extrovert labda. But despite that, kukuwa extrovert has not helped me so much kwa side ya kumeet new people. Yes I'm good with crowds and all that but sasa ikifika the time nafaa kuapproach people and get to know them ile ya kabisa, the introverted side of me tends to come out. I joined Rotaract because my close friend was the club president at that time and alikuwa amenipush sana to come for their meetings, and I'm glad I did. Rotaract has helped me so much to not feel afraid to express myself in front of people. Watu wa Rotaract ni watu very social, hutaboeka. So most of the times huwa najipata nimecreate bonds with people ata I couldn't expect nikuwe friends na wao. That has been a big step for me and I'm proud of myself. I'm really grateful for that.",

      "Rac JKUAT has been everything for me. My mantra in life has been, 'Our main purpose is to help others in life and if you can't, at the very least don't hurt them.' Rac JKUAT has enabled me to be more compassionate, kind, empathetic, less selfish, and above all to be of service to the community and people around me, therefore living my mantra. The best part of it all is that I get to do this while having fun which is amazing‚ùóÔ∏è Rac JKUAT has been amazing. üíØ",

      "It gave me a place to live, I don't usually interact with that many people but it has been a platform for meeting new people, making new memories, having fun and generally being a better version of myself. I love that it is a community that focuses on giving back and helping those in need, and that part really sits tight with me. My only regret is that I didn't join sooner. üòÇüò≠ But all in all I LOVE IT OVER HERE. ‚ù§Ô∏è",

      "I mean, what can I say? I'm lost for words. Through this club I have been able to give back to the community, and have more impact than I ever could, had I been working alone. I have met countless wonderful people and professionals, many of whom have gone on to become close friends and associates. I have grown, both professionally and personally, beyond anything my wildest imagination could have conceived when I first joined. But perhaps most importantly, the club has empowered me to express my creativity, to create something out of nothing, to push the limits of what I thought possible, and to discover my innermost authentic self. For this and for much more I didn't capture here, I will be eternally grateful.",
