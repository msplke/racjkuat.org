Dear Rac JKUAT,

To be honest, when I first met you, I wasn't planning on staying this long. Maybe that's what they call commitment issues! But here I am, completely relishing the beauty of your existence. 🥰 (By the way, I need to write a thank you note to my friend for introducing us.)

Now, you might be wondering why I stayed, right? Well, it's actually quite simple:

- It's the way you selflessly offer your company and friendship. Our weekly fellowships have
  become the highlight of my Mondays. They're a chance to connect, share experiences, and
  simply enjoy each other's company.

- It’s the fun and thrill you effortlessly provide,you sure know how to have a good time. 🥳 The hangouts and events are always worth the wait, and the memories are priceless.

- It's the wisdom and knowledge you courteously share. You've taught me valuable lessons like
  "Be Bold" (kimbelembele reloaded), and the importance of seizing the moment, all for the
  right reasons.

- But most importantly, it's how easily you restore my faith in humanity. On the days when
  doubt creeps in, your dedication and service to the community always melt my heart.

What I really want to say is that I'm so glad I stayed and incredibly proud to be associated with you. Consider this a written promise to offer you as much support as you've given me and to be an extension of your light, laughter, and kindness to the world.

This is a toast to you 🥂, dearest Rac JKUAT, that you may last long and prosper, for you are truly great and mighty. 😌

Forever thankful. ❤️
