Meet Rotactor Paul Omondi, alias "Polito" — a passionate and dedicated member of the Rotaract club of JKUAT. He is currently in his final year of school, pursuing Electrical and Computer Engineering.

He joined the club in 2022, while in his third year of study and his journey so far, in his own words, has been amazing. He has made memories with friends who according to him, have always been there for him. Rotaract has also enabled him to create valuable connections and consequently learned that anything is possible when people come together, especially in the Rotary and Rotaract family. He continues to say that from Rotaract, he has gained a way of life in terms of social interaction and personal growth.

When asked about his best memory so far, he mentions that in 2022 during his induction, he was asked to say the Rotaract Grace and given that he had it memorized correctly, he continued to win a fully paid hike to the Table Mountains which was a truly wonderful moment for him. He expresses his hope for Rotaract in which he hopes that the community continues to grow in the sense that it takes on bigger projects, impacts more people and accomplishes tremendous things in the future.

To conclude, Polito recounts a funny moment where Rotaractor Shimuli, during their induction, said to him, "naomba tukuje tufahamiane" which translates to "I would like us to get to know each other." He found very funny and according to him only people from the Luhya Tribe would get the Swahili joke.

The club truly appreciates Polito's contribution and dedication and wishes him a beautiful future both within and outside the club.
