Caleb Clement Ngwono Odhiambo is a third-year student pursuing a degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. He first learned about Rotaract through his aunt, who is a Rotarian, during a long holiday, which sparked his interest. Through her, he discovered the community service and networking aspects of the organization and felt it was a great fit.

His first meeting was a karaoke night, which he thoroughly enjoyed as he loved the way people interacted with one another. When asked what drives him to give his best, he responded that he considers himself a very considerate person and believes a core part of being human is understanding people's needs and alleviating their pain.

Rotaract has changed his outlook on life, teaching him that there is immense joy in serving others and seeing them happy. He fondly recalls visiting Muthiga Children's Home for a stationery drive and a painting activity. Some children colored in books while others joined in painting their classrooms. Their smiles made him happy and resonated with a part of himself he had yet to explore.

One of his guiding principles is to show up and give his best in everything he does. These efforts led to his recognition as Rotaractor of the Month. His advice to others aiming for similar recognition is to stop focusing on being acknowledged; instead, do your best within the circumstances, so that whether you’re recognized or not, improvement remains your goal.

Finally, something people may not know about Caleb is his love for history. He believes that there is much to learn from the past and that failing to do so means risking the repetition of others' mistakes.
